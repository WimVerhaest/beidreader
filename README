BeIDReader: Tool for reading BeID-cards and creating a csv-file that can be imported into PACXS
===============================================================================================

Prerequisites:
1) Java JDK 1.8.x
2) Maven 3.x
3) A valid BeID-reader (to be tested with Eid-viewer)

How to install and use:
1) Configure Maven properly.
2) Start a cmd-tool and go to the top-directory (where the file pom.xml resides).
Execute the following command:
mvn package

3) The first time it can take a while but you get a 'target'-directory where you find, amongst others, the following file:
BeIDReader-jar-with-dependencies.jar

This is your java-'executable'. You can execute it with the following command:
java -jar BeIDReader-jar-with-dependencies.jar <startdirectory>

The software has a help-page with more exaplanations.

Enjoy yourselves,
